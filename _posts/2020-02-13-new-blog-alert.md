I always wanted to host a blog in my actual domain. I have pondered ober this many times over the past year. I finally took the leap! I do have two blogs in wordpress ([Broken Typewriter](https://priyanmuthu.wordpress.com/)), where I generally post my prose and poems. But I wanted a Journal - where I can post my journey through life. 

I hope to frequently post here. Will keep you upaded. Until then watch this [funny hamster compilation in youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrShUyusEUo).
